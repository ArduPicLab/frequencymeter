A PIC based 50MHz frequency meter
By Giovanni Carrera â€“ rev. 02/07/2016

This project describes the realization of a sensible and accurate instrument to measure frequencies up to 50 MHz of signal amplitudes up to a few tens of millivolts. The instrument is small in size and can be battery powered, so it is a handheld instrument.
